# How To Use Markdown
Markdown is a simple way to format text to be prepared for HTML. Long descriptions are saved as HTML to be displayed accurately across a variety of mediums. On this page you can find examples of the most basic types of markdown formatting to allow you to properly format your long product description.

## Headers
Headers allow you to create larger fonts at the beginning of sections. To use headers, simply place a `#` in front of text at the beginning of a new line, such as:
```
# Heading 1
## Heading 2
### Heading 3
#### Heading 4
```

## Styling Fonts
You may use either underscores (`_`) or asterisks (`*`) in markdown to create emphasis.

Examples and display can be seen below:
Make text _italicized_ using _single underscores_ or *single asterisks*.
`Make text _italicized_ using _single underscores_ or *single asterisks*.`
Make text __bold__ using __double underscores__ or **double asterisks**.
`Make text __bold__ using __double underscores__ or **double asterisks**.`

## Lists
**Unordered Lists**
Unordered list can be made by placing a `-` on each new line.
- Item 1
- Item 2
- Item 3
```
- Item 1
- Item 2
- Item 3
```

**Ordered Lists**
Ordered list can be made by placing a new number on each new line.
1. Item 1
2. Item 2
3. Item 3
```
1. Item 1
2. Item 2
3. Item 3
```

**Sub Lists**
Placing a space at the beginning of a new line will create indented lists. You can also combine list types.
1. A first item
 - Details about the first item
 - More details
2. A second item
 - Some details about the first item
  1. Another list indented further.
  2. This list is indented with 2 spaces.
```
